# p-value Data

## GWAS data for AD (or any disease)

When GWAS data for interest disease need be collected, please search the disease in GWAS catalog and download corresponding GWAS Summary data. Afterwards, beedtools can be used to map SNP loci to genes, thus corresponding genes to p-values.


## p-value data for cancer

In the case when ones would to collect the p-value for cancer, please search the disease in TCGA database and download corresponding files. The downloaded files needs to contain the p-value and Entrez ID for each disease-related gene, note that both significant (less than the threshold) and insignificant (greater than threshold) p-values need to be included.
