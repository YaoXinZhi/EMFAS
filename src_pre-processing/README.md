# Data Preprocessing

## Text Embedding Calculation
This step is used to perform BERT-based embedding calculation on the gene literature files as well as biomedical concept annotations.


    python bag_embedding.py --input [intput_lit/bio-concept_file] --output [lit/bio-concept_embedding_file]
                            --max_len [MAX_LEN]





## Graph Embedding filter


## Embedding Merge with fixed weights
